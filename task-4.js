//* Task 4

/*
 # In this task we're going to do things differently:

 # Start by writing a test for a capitalize(string) function. Your test should make sure that this function takes a string as an argument and returns that string with the first character capitalized.

 # Run your test - it should fail because you donâ€™t have the capitalize(string) function implemented yet.
  
 # Now make your tests green by implementing the capitalize(string) function. Think about what the minimum amount of code is necessary to pass this test and write it.
*/

function capitalize(string) {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}

module.exports = capitalize;

// console.log(capitalize('banana'));
// console.log(capitalize('me'));
// console.log(capitalize('hello'));
